# ðŸ¤– B.E.N.
homelab est. 2025

**B.E.N.** is the name of my server. I named it after the robot in the movie _Treasure Planet_. In the movie B.E.N. (Bio Electronic Navigator) is a navigator robot who has had his memory module damaged/corrupted. As a result, he gets confused at times. That's how I feel when working on my server. At times, like B.E.N., I'm having a great time, but suddenly I'm confused and unsure what's going on. What is this issue? How did I get here? To quote Ben in the movie: "I've lost my mind. Ha ha! I've lost my mind! You haven't found it, have you?"
