# B.E.N.

B.E.N. is the name of my server. I named it after the robot in the movie Treasure Planet. In the movie B.E.N. ,Bio Electronic Navigator, is a navigator robot who has had his memory module damaged/corrupted. So he get confused at times in the movie. That is how I feel when working on my server. At times like Ben I am having a great time. Suddenly I am confused and unsure what is going on? What is this issue? How did I get here? To quote Ben in the movie: "I've lost my mind. Ha ha! I've lost my mind! You haven't found it, have you?"
